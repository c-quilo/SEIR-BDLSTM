# SEIR-BDLSTM
A non-intrusive reduced-order model of an epidemiological Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered - Susceptible (SEIRS) model. The SEIRS model is an idealised town following parameters reported in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SEIRS model has two grops: Home (can't leave home) and Mobile. This is a digital twin of say SEIRS model, where we approximate the original model solution using a Bidirectional LSTM.
